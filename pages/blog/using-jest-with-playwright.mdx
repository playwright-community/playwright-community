Having a test runner like Jest configured has a lot of benefits instead of writing your tests from scratch. It gives you out of the box the ability of focusing a single test, providing a formatted output or a whole suite for common assertions called `expect` in Jest. The framework is maintained by Facebook and is mostly the default choice for writing frontend or backend unit tests in the JavaScript ecosystem. It's framework agnostic and by that you can test with it e.g. your express backend or your React components.

The way how you should integrate Playwright into your project depends on your needs. Currently there two common ways of doing that. Either you can do it manually by using the hooks (`beforeAll`, `afterAll`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`) or you use [`jest-playwright`](https://github.com/playwright-community/jest-playwright). We recommend to use jest-playwright due it has features like:
- Multi browser and device (like iPhones with given screen sizes) support
- [jest-dev-server](http://yarnpkg.com/en/package/jest-dev-server) integration which can start your webserver like React before running the tests
- [expect-playwright](https://github.com/playwright-community/expect-playwright) integration which provides common `expect` helpers

### Using `jest-playwright`

To get started we first have to install the needed Node.js packages either over NPM or Yarn. It's common to install them as `devDependencies` so they won't be installed on your production environments.

```txt
npm install -D jest jest-playwright-preset playwright
```

Instead of installing all the browsers with the `playwright` package, you can also just install e.g. `playwright-chromium` to save bandwidth and storage on your system and have by that a faster installation time.

Once we installed the dependecies, we have to create a Jest configuration to instruct Jest which preset should be used for which files. You can either reuse your existing / default configuration (`jest.config.js`) or create a custom one and name it e.g. `jest.e2e.config.js`. In the end when you run your tests, you then have to specific the custom config file with the `-c` flag. It's also common to separate your unit tests from the end-to-end tests with separate configuration files.

Inside the Jest configuration file you have to put:

```js
module.exports = {
    preset: "jest-playwright-preset"
}
```

Also since this is a normal Jest configuration you can pass a RegExp which files should Jest run. It's useful to use e.g. a custom folder or file suffix as a naming convention to separate your unit tests from the end-to-end tests. See here as a reference for the [`testRegex`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#testregex-string--arraystring) setting.

For the basic configuration this is already enough to get started. If you want to setup custom browsers, devices, screen resolutions or settings for Playwright, then you need a custom Playwright configuration. Create a file called `jest-playwright.config.js` in the root directory of your project to use the settings which are descriped in the [jest-playwright documentation](https://github.com/playwright-community/jest-playwright#configuration).

```js
module.exports = {
  launchBrowserApp: {
    headless: true
  },
  context: {
    ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,
    viewport: {
      width: 1920,
      height: 1080
    }
  },
  browsers: ["chromium", "firefox"],
  devices: []
}
```

Keep in mind, that all the values (including keys) in the configuration are optional and only showed here to give demonstrate and give insights how it can be used in common testing setups.

To run your tests you can add `jest` or `jest -c config.e2e.config.js` to your `scripts` section of your `package.json` to run them easier by using `npm run test`.

Here's an example output how it will look like:

```txt
Profile Settings
    ✓ should be redirected to login page if not logged in (568ms)
    ✓ should be able to login by email and password (404ms)
    ✓ should be able to see their email and name on account settings page (155ms)
    ✓ should be able to change their email and name on account settings page (562ms)
File handling
    ✓ should be able to import a CSV (705ms)
    ✓ should be able to view a files (742ms)
    ✓ should be able to delete a file (606ms)
    ✓ should be able to edit a file (806ms)
```

For more information about `jest-playwright` you'll find the documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/playwright-community/jest-playwright).

### More light-weight solution

As you can see in the following code, we use the lifecycle hooks to launch a browser before all the tests which will be closed once all are done. For every test `beforeEach` we are creating a new page which will be used inside the tests. In this example we are visiting example.com and testing if the title of it contains `Example Domain`.

```js
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const expect = require('expect');
let browser;
let page;
beforeAll(async () => {
  browser = await chromium.launch();
});
afterAll(async () => {
  await browser.close();
});
beforeEach(async () => {
  page = await browser.newPage();
});
afterEach(async () => {
  await page.close();
});
it('should work', async () => {
  await page.goto('https://www.example.com/');
  expect(await page.title()).toBe('Example Domain');
});
```

In the creation of the browser (`chromium.launch`) or the creation of the page (`browser.newPage`) you can passs options e.g. to start the browser in normal mode to manually click around or to ignore invalid SSL certificates which is useful for local testing.
