## Introduction

Playwright Test is a new test runner built from scratch by the Playwright team specifically to accommodate end-to-end testing needs. Join Principal Engineer, [Andrey Lushnikov](https://twitter.com/aslushnikov) as he demonstrates how to use Playwright Test to author new tests, how to migrate existing tests, how to deploy them on CI, and debug them if something goes wrong.

## Highlights include:

- Running tests across all browsers.
- Execute tests in parallel.
- Enjoy context isolation and sensible defaults out of the box.
- Capture traces, videos, screenshots and other artifacts on failure.
- Infinitely extensible with fixtures.
